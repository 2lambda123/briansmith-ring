Build Prerequisites:

  * Perl 5.6.1 or later is required. On Windows, Strawberry Perl and MSYS Perl
    have both been reported to work.

  * A C compiler is required:
    * Visual Studio 2013 or later on Windows.
    * GCC 4.8 or later, or Clang 3.4 or later on Linux.

  * Go[1] is currently required for running the tests.

Upstream BoringSSL uses CMake. ring uses GNU Make instead:

  make -j6 CC=clang-3.7 CXX=clang-3.7++ BITS=64

The default build is a debug build. You can build a release build with:

  make -j6 CC=clang-3.7 CXX=clang-3.7++ BITS=64 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELWITHDEBINFO

There is no "./configure" step yet, though there probably should be one.

Upstream BoringSSL supports building shared libraries. ring (currently) does
not build *any* libraries. Instead, it expects you to link the object files
named in $(RING_OBJS) directly into your project. Of course, you can create a
static library if you want.

Currently Windows isn't supported. Later there will be a Visual Studio solution
that can be built using msbuild or the IDE.
